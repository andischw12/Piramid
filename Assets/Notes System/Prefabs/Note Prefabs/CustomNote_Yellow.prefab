    I managed to find the button that opens the main school gate, this place is really
    strange, eerie, hard to believe that this was once a fully functioning boarding
    school.\x03\rThe Main Entrance was locked, I stumbled upon a set of keys in the
    security cabin, I guess these might open that side door. It\u2019s probably just
    in my head but I could have sworn someone is following me; it will be that janitor\u2026
