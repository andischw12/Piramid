Mobile Wood Boxes

1.Easy To use setup. Just select objects from prefab, place it in your scene 
  and you good to go.

2. Chests have pivot point for top lid in location that will make it easy to animate.

3. Materials are set To Mobile/BumpedSpecular(1 Directional Light) - you may want to change them for performance reasons.

4. Diffuse Textures have specular layer in alpha chanel. This is becuse unity
   built in shaders uses this for specularity. But no worries if you have some
   different shader that uses specular as separate map you can use 2 specular maps
   that I include:
   - WoodBoxesDiffuseMap_01 = WoodBoxesSpecularMap_01
   - WoodBoxesDiffuseMap_02 = WoodBoxesSpecularMap_02  

5. And normal maps:
   - WoodBoxesDiffuseMap_01 = WoodBoxesNormalMap_01
   - WoodBoxesDiffuseMap_02 = WoodBoxesNormalMap_02
   
6. Ground Texture and Material are just an addition. 
   You can use them how ever you want.
