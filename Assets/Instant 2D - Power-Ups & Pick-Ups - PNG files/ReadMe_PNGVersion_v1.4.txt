Hi there!

Thanks a lot for supporting us by buying "INSTANT 2D - POWER-UPS & PICK-UPS (PNG VERSION)".

We've spent a lot of time on making this collection of power-up & pick-up textures, and we hope it will be a shortcut to awesome games for you.

It contains a total of 915 textures in PNG format. There are 180 unique icons in 5 styles: Outline, Bubble, Glow, Orb and Plain. In addition there are 15 coloured bubbles, glow and orb textures.

The textures are suitable for many different game genres, e.g. platformers, RPGs, action and puzzle games.

The textures are provided as high-resolution PNG files. The texture height (or width in some cases) is at least 1024 pixels. All you need to do is to batch resize the textures to a size which is right for your application, and you're good to go.
